This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, performance issue in C++ related to the use of `std::vector<bool>`.  While seemingly a space-saving choice, its implementation using bitsets can significantly impact performance, particularly for frequent element access. The example code showcases this inefficiency and presents a solution for improved performance using alternative containers when appropriate.
